        <h1>Canada</h1>
        <p>
            Canada, the second-largest country in the world by land area, is known for its breathtaking natural landscapes, 
            multicultural society, and high quality of life. Located in North America, it shares the longest international 
            border with the United States and is surrounded by the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic Oceans. With ten provinces 
            and three territories, Canada is a vast and diverse nation that experiences all four seasons, from harsh winters 
            in the north to mild coastal climates in the west.

            Canada has a rich history, from its indigenous First Nations, Métis, and Inuit peoples to European colonization 
            by the French and British. The country became a self-governing dominion in 1867 and has since developed into a 
            global leader in human rights, environmental protection, and technological innovation. Today, Canada is known 
            for its strong democratic system, universal healthcare, and peaceful reputation.

            The country's major cities offer a unique mix of modernity and tradition. Ottawa, the capital, is home to the 
            iconic Parliament Hill. Toronto, the largest city, is a financial hub known for the CN Tower and its diverse 
            population. Vancouver is famous for its stunning natural surroundings, while Montreal is known for its French 
            culture, historic architecture, and vibrant festivals. Calgary, often called the "Gateway to the Rockies," is 
            known for its oil industry and annual Calgary Stampede.

            Canada's natural beauty is one of its biggest attractions. The Rocky Mountains, Niagara Falls, Banff National 
            Park, and the Northern Lights in the Yukon make it a dream destination for nature lovers and adventure seekers. 
            The country has one of the largest forest reserves in the world and is home to wildlife such as bears, moose, 
            and bald eagles. In winter, activities like skiing, snowboarding, and ice hockey are deeply embedded in 
            Canadian culture.

            Canadian culture is shaped by its diverse immigrant communities and indigenous heritage. The country is officially 
            bilingual, with English and French as its two official languages. Canada is known for its friendly people and 
            social policies that promote inclusivity and multiculturalism. Festivals like the Toronto International Film 
            Festival, Quebec Winter Carnival, and Canada Day celebrations highlight the nation's rich traditions.

            Canada has one of the strongest economies in the world, with industries ranging from natural resources and 
            technology to entertainment and aerospace. It is a major producer of timber, oil, and minerals while also leading 
            in sectors like artificial intelligence and renewable energy. The country’s strong trade relationships, particularly 
            with the United States and China, contribute to its economic stability.

            Overall, Canada is a country that offers a high standard of living, stunning landscapes, and a welcoming society. 
            Whether exploring its vibrant cities, hiking through its national parks, or experiencing its rich culture, Canada 
            is a place that continues to inspire people from all over the world.
