        <h1>Egypt</h1>
        <p>
            Egypt, known as the "Gift of the Nile," is one of the world's most ancient civilizations. Located in 
            North Africa, Egypt is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, Sudan to the south, Libya to 
            the west, and Israel and the Red Sea to the east. With a history spanning over 5,000 years, Egypt is 
            home to some of the most famous historical monuments, including the Great Pyramids of Giza, the Sphinx, 
            and the temples of Luxor and Karnak.

            The Nile River has been the lifeline of Egypt since ancient times, providing water for agriculture and 
            enabling the rise of one of the world's greatest civilizations. The ancient Egyptians built a vast empire, 
            ruled by powerful pharaohs such as Ramses II, Tutankhamun, and Cleopatra. The country developed one of 
            the earliest writing systems—hieroglyphics—and made significant advancements in mathematics, medicine, 
            and architecture.

            Cairo, the capital of Egypt, is the largest city in the Arab world and a vibrant hub of culture, politics, 
            and education. It is home to the Egyptian Museum, which houses thousands of artifacts from ancient Egypt, 
            including the treasures of King Tutankhamun. The city is a mix of modern skyscrapers and historical Islamic 
            architecture, with famous landmarks such as the Citadel of Saladin and the Al-Azhar Mosque.

            Egypt is also famous for its Red Sea coastline, which attracts tourists for its stunning coral reefs and 
            diving spots in cities like Sharm El-Sheikh and Hurghada. The country’s vast deserts, including the Sahara 
            and the White Desert, offer breathtaking landscapes with golden sand dunes and unique rock formations.

            Egyptian cuisine is rich and flavorful, with popular dishes like koshari (a mix of pasta, rice, lentils, 
            and tomato sauce), ful medames (mashed fava beans), and kebabs. The country's tea and coffee culture 
            is also an essential part of daily life.

            Today, Egypt remains an important cultural and political center in the Middle East and Africa. It has 
            one of the fastest-growing economies in the region, with developments in tourism, agriculture, and the 
            Suez Canal, which is a key global trade route. Despite modern challenges, Egypt's historical legacy 
            continues to inspire scholars, travelers, and historians worldwide.
